# Compare Them
Compare two places with Google Maps API side by side

# Installation notes
The frontend is uses my Google Cloud Functions, these may disappear at any point. After deploying the code in the backend update the URLs in the frontend so that they point ot your new functions. At some point in the furture I plan on making an installation script which can run all commands to deploy these to google cloud but this will most likely be far far in the future.
